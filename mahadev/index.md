# Mahadev


In a village, Shiva ruled as the king and held sway over his kingdom. However, over time, two influential individuals arrived from another land. They were known as Vishnu and Brahma, each having their own kingdom in their homeland. These newcomers quickly earned a reputation in the village as powerful kings.

As time passed, the three rulers contemplated the idea of determining who among them would be considered the "Mahadevta" or "Mahadev," a significant title often associated with Lord Shiva. Vishnu had already been celebrated for his divine incarnations in other lands, leaving Brahma and Shiva as the remaining contenders for the title.

After extensive discussions, it seemed that Brahma was on the verge of becoming the Mahadev. His excitement got the better of him, and he lost control over his desires. This situation was only brought under control when his daughter, Saraswati, intervened. However, this event led to the villagers' displeasure, and the position of Mahadev was transferred to Shiva.

From that day onwards, Shiva was revered as the Mahadev, while Brahma was not as prominently worshipped.
